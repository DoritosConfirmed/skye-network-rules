# Official Rules

**Server Rules:**

✔️ 1. English only in all chats

✔️ 2. Full nudity, porn, sexual gore images, rape, obscene intense material is not allowed to be posted within the server, the NSFW channel is no exception to this.

✔️ 3. Keep the server a friendly place. Respect the members and staff in the server. There will be zero tolerance for those who bully others. The server is made up of individuals from different cultures, ethnicites, sexual orientations, genders, and races; the staff will not put up with those using these different qualities in people to bully others.

✔️ 4. The server is considered R-17, swearing is allowed minimmaly. We don't want exccessive swearing all over the place. These words are banned in the server: Ni--er,F-g,Fa--ot, or any other racial slur.

✔️ 5. Talking of rape or sexual assault is not allowed.

✔️ 6. Report staff to an admin if you notice them abusing their rights, treating members poorly, or behaving in a way that may need to be looked further into. All of the server admins have the @Server Admin role, those are the ones you report to. If a staff member is sexually harassing a member, report the staff member to owner Aleks directly, they are the one with the @Bureaucrat role.

✔️ 7. Spam? NO SPAM. This rule is for all channels. Keep tagging at a minimal, don’t excessively ping staff or other members. Don't use spammy nicknames, if a staff feels your nickname is spammy, they have the freedom to change it. [Playing in the Bots channel isn't considered as spamming]

✔️ 8. Advertisements such as Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch, Steam link, etc (keep Discord invites to a minimum) should always be posted in #self-promotion. The advertisement category is marked with the 📢 icon

✔️ 9. No hate speech of any kind. Racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive will not be tolerated

✔️ 10. The server is an inclusive safe space for all. However, we are not professionals. We cannot assist you during suicidal episodes or any intense behavioural/mental stress. If you're in an emergency situation and need help please contact any of the following hotlines who will gladly help you through it. We are here for you but again, we are not licensed professionals.

**SKYE Rules:**

✔️ 1. ORG application links go in #org-advertisements and Discord server links to viewing lounges should be in #vl-advertisements. These both can be found under the advertisement category

✔️ 2. An ORG bureaucrat can request to be an official partner with SKYE Network, talk with SKYE’s bureaucrat to make that request. ORG Partners get a role in the server as well as priority advertisements, and a placement on the SKYE Network wiki

✔️ 3. Do **NOT** talk about current games in the main chat. If you’d like to talk about on-going SKYE games, assign a viewing lounge role to access the discussion channels, or join the season’s viewing lounge posted in #current-games

✔️ 4. Only assign a viewing lounge role if you’re currently not playing the game. Players who assign themselves the viewing lounge role will be removed from their game with a cheating strike. This offense will not only be blasted onto our cheaters list, but you’ll also be added to the blacklist players and will not be able to return playing any future SKYE games

✔️ 5. SKYE Network holds individuality as one of our core values. We’re always looking for new and creative ways to bring enjoyment to Online Reality Games. We’re always happy to expand our Host and Artist teams, if you’re interested in hosting for SKYE or making seasonal art, the applications can be found on the wiki listed under “Current Applications”

✔️ 6. Joining the SKYE Team means you’ll get server roles to embrace your new position in our growing community. Rep the SKYE Host, SKYE Staff, SKYE Dev, or SKYE Artist roles as well as be added to our Wiki staff page! (Pst you also get a custom manga repping SKYE Network merch) 

✔️ 7. Periodically as the official Server grows, so will our server staff team. This is an entirely different team than the Official SKYE Team. The Server Team’s responsibilities will only be server based. The Helper application will be released anytime the Server Admins feel like we need some extra pairs of hands. Look at for these in the announcements!

✔️ 8. SKYE hosts and SKYE winners will receive their own roles as each game is announced/finished. The Winners will be separated on the Online User List as well for everyone to glorify our amazing winners.
